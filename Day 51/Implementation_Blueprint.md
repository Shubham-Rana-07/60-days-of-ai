# HireLens — Implementation Blueprint (Day 2–10)
## AI Job Match & Resume Analyzer — 10-Day Capstone Build Plan

**Companion document to:** HireLens_PRD.md
**Purpose:** This is the single source of truth for building HireLens from Day 2 through Day 10. Each day is written so that a **fresh AI conversation** can pick it up and continue building without redesigning, re-planning, or re-deciding architecture. Copy the relevant day's section into a new conversation along with the PRD to continue seamlessly.

**Ground Rules (apply every day):**
- Follow the Scope Discipline Rule from the PRD — anything not part of the core workflow goes into a `v2_ideas.md` backlog file, not into today's build.
- Assume ~3–4 focused hours/day (up to 5 on heavier days).
- Every day ends with a working, testable increment — never leave the app in a broken state overnight.
- Every day ends with a Git commit and a short entry in a running `PROGRESS_LOG.md`.
- If a fresh AI conversation is starting a new day, it should be given: this day's section, the PRD, and the previous day's "Handoff Notes."

## 📅 DAY 2 — Design, Architecture & Environment Setup

### 🎯 Objective
Finalize the technical architecture and tech stack (deferred from Day 1 by design), set up the project skeleton, version control, and local development environment so every subsequent day is pure feature-building — no infrastructure decisions left mid-build.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- How to translate a PRD into a concrete system architecture.
- How to structure a Python web application for separation of concerns (parsing, scoring, AI, reporting, UI).
- Environment variable management for secrets (API keys) done correctly from day one.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- No user-facing features today — this is foundation day.
- Project scaffolding, empty routes/pages that confirm the app runs end-to-end ("hello world" skeleton).

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Confirm the tech stack** (recommended, based on PRD Section 9 and Ansh's existing skills):
   - Backend: **Python + Flask**
   - Resume parsing: `pdfplumber` (PDF), `python-docx` (DOCX)
   - Rule-based scoring: pure Python + lightweight NLP (`re`, custom skill dictionaries; optionally `scikit-learn` for TF-IDF-based match scoring if needed)
   - AI layer: **Claude API** (via `anthropic` Python SDK), wrapped in a dedicated `ai_service.py` module with a clean interface (e.g., `generate_suggestions(resume_text, jd_text, analysis_summary) -> structured_dict`) so the provider can be swapped later.
   - PDF report generation: `reportlab` (fine-grained layout control) or `WeasyPrint` (HTML/CSS-to-PDF, faster to make "look professional" if comfortable with CSS) — **decide based on comfort with CSS vs. direct PDF layout code.**
   - Frontend: Server-rendered HTML (Jinja2 templates) + vanilla CSS/JS, or a lightweight component approach — kept simple since this is a single-page-feeling app with one primary workflow.
   - Deployment target: A free-tier platform that supports Python + environment variables (e.g., Render, Railway, or PythonAnywhere — final pick confirmed on Day 10 setup based on what's available/free at the time).

2. **Design the system architecture.** Confirm these modules as separate, independently testable Python modules:
   - `parsing/` — extracts raw text from PDF/DOCX.
   - `scoring/` — ATS score, match %, missing skills, keyword analysis (pure functions, no I/O).
   - `ai_service/` — Claude API integration, isolated and swappable.
   - `report/` — PDF report generation.
   - `app.py` / `routes/` — Flask app, request handling, wiring modules together.
   - `templates/` and `static/` — frontend.

3. **Draw a simple architecture diagram** (can be a basic box-and-arrow diagram, made in any tool — even draw.io, Excalidraw, or hand-drawn and photographed). Flow: `User → Flask Routes → [Parsing → Scoring] + [AI Service] → Report Generator → Response to User`. Save as `docs/architecture_diagram.png`.

4. **Initialize the project:**
   - Create project root folder: `hirelens/`
   - Initialize Git: `git init`
   - Create `.gitignore` (Python template — exclude `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, uploaded files, generated reports).
   - Create and activate a virtual environment.
   - Install initial dependencies: `flask`, `python-dotenv`, `anthropic`.
   - Create `requirements.txt`.

5. **Set up environment variable management:**
   - Create `.env` (gitignored) with placeholder `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
   - Create `.env.example` (committed) documenting required variables without real values.
   - Load via `python-dotenv` in the app.

6. **Build the skeleton Flask app:**
   - `app.py` with a basic route (`/`) rendering a placeholder homepage.
   - Confirm it runs locally (`flask run` or `python app.py`) and loads in the browser.

7. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Create a new public repo named `hirelens`.
   - Push the initial skeleton commit.
   - Add a placeholder `README.md` (to be expanded daily).

8. **Create supporting docs:**
   - `docs/architecture_diagram.png`
   - `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` (one-line entry per day going forward)
   - `docs/v2_ideas.md` (empty backlog file for scope-creep parking lot)

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- Flask, python-dotenv, anthropic SDK (installed, not yet called).
- Git + GitHub.

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Confirm `flask run` starts without errors.
- Confirm homepage loads in browser at `localhost:5000` (or configured port).
- Confirm `.env` values load correctly (print/log a masked confirmation, never the raw key).
- Confirm `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.env` and `venv/` (check `git status`).

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Virtual environment not activating:** confirm you're using the correct activation command for your OS/shell.
- **`.env` not loading:** confirm `load_dotenv()` is called before accessing `os.environ`, and `.env` is in the project root.
- **Port already in use:** change Flask's port or kill the conflicting process.
- **Accidentally committing `.env`:** if it happens, remove from Git history immediately (`git rm --cached .env`) and rotate the API key.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] Tech stack confirmed and documented in `README.md`
- [ ] Architecture diagram created and saved
- [ ] Project skeleton runs locally
- [ ] GitHub repo created and initial commit pushed
- [ ] `.env` / `.env.example` set up correctly, `.env` confirmed gitignored
- [ ] `PROGRESS_LOG.md` and `v2_ideas.md` created

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 3
Tech stack is finalized: Python/Flask backend, `pdfplumber` + `python-docx` for parsing, custom rule-based scoring, Claude API via `ai_service/`, PDF report via reportlab/WeasyPrint (confirm final pick), Jinja2 + vanilla CSS/JS frontend. Project skeleton is live locally and on GitHub. Day 3 begins building the resume parsing module inside `parsing/`.

---

## 📅 DAY 3 — Resume Parsing Module (PDF/DOCX)

### 🎯 Objective
Build a reliable module that extracts clean, usable text from uploaded PDF and DOCX resumes — this is the foundation every other feature depends on, so it's built and stress-tested early (per the PRD's top identified risk).

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Practical PDF/DOCX text extraction and its real-world messiness.
- Defensive file-handling (validation, size limits, corrupted file handling).
- Designing a module with a clean, predictable output contract for downstream code.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- File upload endpoint (resume only, for now).
- PDF text extraction.
- DOCX text extraction.
- Basic text cleanup (whitespace normalization, encoding issues).
- Upload validation (file type, size limit, corrupted file handling).

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Define the parsing module's output contract** in `parsing/`:
   ```python
   def parse_resume(file_path: str, file_type: str) -> dict:
       # Returns: {
       #   "success": bool,
       #   "raw_text": str,
       #   "error": str | None
       # }
   ```
   Keep this contract consistent regardless of PDF or DOCX input — downstream modules should never need to know which file type was uploaded.

2. **Implement `parsing/pdf_parser.py`** using `pdfplumber`:
   - Open the PDF, iterate pages, extract text.
   - Handle empty/None text per page gracefully (some PDFs have images instead of text — flag this case with a clear error like "This PDF appears to be scanned/image-based; please upload a text-based PDF").

3. **Implement `parsing/docx_parser.py`** using `python-docx`:
   - Extract paragraph text and table text (resumes sometimes use tables for layout).
   - Preserve section breaks with newlines for readability downstream.

4. **Implement `parsing/cleaner.py`:**
   - Normalize whitespace (collapse multiple spaces/newlines).
   - Strip non-printable/control characters.
   - Preserve line breaks between resume sections (don't flatten everything into one paragraph — scoring logic will benefit from some structure).

5. **Wire into Flask (`app.py` or `routes/upload.py`):**
   - Add a `POST /upload-resume` route.
   - Validate: file present, extension is `.pdf` or `.docx`, size ≤ 5MB.
   - Call the appropriate parser based on extension.
   - Return parsed text (for now, just display it on a simple results page — full dashboard comes later).

6. **Build a minimal upload UI** in `templates/index.html`:
   - A file input + submit button.
   - Display extracted text below (temporary, for verification — will be replaced by the real dashboard on Day 7).

7. **Collect test resumes:** Gather/create 5–8 varied sample resumes (different formats: single-column, two-column, resumes with tables, resumes with bullet points, PDF exports from Canva/Word/LaTeX, and a DOCX). Store in a local `test_files/` folder (gitignored — don't commit real resumes; use anonymized/dummy ones if needed).

### 📂 Files/Folders to Create/Modify

├── __init__.py
├── pdf_parser.py
├── docx_parser.py
└── cleaner.py
routes/ (or inline in app.py)
└── upload.py
templates/
└── index.html (add upload form)
test_files/ (gitignored, local only)
```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- `pdfplumber`
- `python-docx`
- Flask file upload handling (`request.files`)

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Upload each of the 5–8 test resumes; confirm text extracts and reads correctly.
- Upload a corrupted/invalid file; confirm a clean error message (no crash).
- Upload an oversized file; confirm size validation triggers.
- Upload a scanned/image-based PDF; confirm the graceful "no extractable text" error path.
- Upload a `.txt` or `.jpg` file; confirm file-type validation rejects it clearly.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Garbled text from PDFs:** some PDFs use unusual encodings/fonts — if `pdfplumber` struggles, log the raw output and inspect; consider a fallback library only if truly necessary (avoid over-engineering here).
- **Tables in DOCX resumes:** `python-docx` doesn't extract table text by default with `.paragraphs` alone — explicitly iterate `document.tables`.
- **Multi-column resumes reading out of order:** this is a known limitation of text extraction; note it as a documented constraint rather than trying to solve perfectly — flag in `docs/known_limitations.md`.
- **Large files hanging the request:** confirm size limit is enforced *before* parsing begins.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] PDF parser working and tested on 4+ real PDF resumes
- [ ] DOCX parser working and tested on 2+ real DOCX resumes
- [ ] Upload validation (type, size, corrupted file) working
- [ ] Clear, user-friendly error messages for all failure cases
- [ ] `docs/known_limitations.md` created noting multi-column/scanned-PDF constraints

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: successful upload showing extracted resume text.
- Screenshot: error handling for an invalid/corrupted file.

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 4
Resume parsing (`parsing/pdf_parser.py`, `parsing/docx_parser.py`, `parsing/cleaner.py`) is complete and returns clean text via `parse_resume()`. Known limitation: multi-column and scanned/image PDFs have reduced accuracy (documented). Day 4 builds the job description input flow and begins the rule-based keyword extraction/matching engine, consuming this parsed resume text plus new JD text.

---

## 📅 DAY 4 — Job Description Input & Keyword Extraction Engine

### 🎯 Objective
Build the job description input flow and the first half of the rule-based intelligence: extracting meaningful keywords/skills from both the JD and the resume so they can be compared.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Practical, lightweight NLP techniques (without needing heavy ML models).
- Building and maintaining a skills/keyword taxonomy relevant to Indian IT job postings.
- Designing scoring logic as pure, testable functions.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- Job description input (paste text; optional file upload reusing Day 3 parser).
- Keyword/skill extraction from both resume and JD.
- A maintainable "skills dictionary" covering common IT/software skills, tools, and technologies relevant to Indian job postings.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Add JD input to the UI:** a large textarea for pasting JD text, with a minimum character count validation (e.g., 100+ characters) and a friendly error if too short.

2. **Build `scoring/skills_dictionary.py`:** a structured, maintainable list of common skills/keywords grouped by category, e.g.:
   ```python
   SKILLS_DB = {
       "programming_languages": ["python", "java", "javascript", "c++", "sql", ...],
       "frameworks_libraries": ["flask", "django", "react", "node.js", "spring boot", ...],
       "databases": ["mysql", "postgresql", "mongodb", "oracle", ...],
       "tools_platforms": ["git", "docker", "aws", "azure", "power bi", "excel", ...],
       "soft_skills": ["communication", "leadership", "teamwork", "problem solving", ...],
       # extend with data/analytics-specific and general IT-services-relevant terms
   }
   ```
   Seed this with 100–150+ terms relevant to Indian IT job postings (draw from Ansh's own resume/job search experience for realism).

3. **Build `scoring/keyword_extractor.py`:**
   - `extract_keywords(text: str) -> set[str]` — lowercases text, matches against `SKILLS_DB` (and handles common variations/synonyms, e.g., "js" vs "javascript"), returns a normalized set of detected skills/keywords.
   - Also extract general significant terms beyond the fixed dictionary using simple frequency-based heuristics (e.g., capitalized multi-word terms, noun phrases) as a secondary signal — keep this lightweight, don't over-engineer with heavy NLP models.

4. **Wire into Flask:** extend the upload/analyze route to also accept and validate JD text, and run `extract_keywords()` on both resume text and JD text, temporarily displaying both keyword sets on the page for verification.

5. **Test against real JDs:** collect 5+ real job descriptions from Indian IT companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini, Deloitte, plus 1–2 product companies) and confirm keyword extraction captures the genuinely important terms.

### 📂 Files/Folders to Create/Modify

└── keyword_extractor.py
templates/
└── index.html (add JD input field)
test_files/
└── sample_jds/ (local, can be committed — JDs are not sensitive like resumes)
```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- Pure Python (`re`, `set` operations). No external NLP API needed for this step — keep it fast and free.

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Run keyword extraction against 5+ real JDs; manually verify extracted terms make sense.
- Run keyword extraction against 3+ resumes; manually verify extracted terms make sense.
- Test edge cases: JD with unusual formatting (bullet symbols, bold markers as text artifacts), very short JD, very long JD.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Missing obvious skills:** dictionary is incomplete — iteratively expand `SKILLS_DB` based on real JD testing; this will keep growing through Day 5.
- **False positives (irrelevant common words matched):** tighten matching (e.g., word-boundary regex matching instead of naive substring matching, so "java" doesn't match inside "javascript" incorrectly, or vice versa).
- **Case/format mismatches** ("Node.js" vs "nodejs" vs "node js"): build a small synonym/alias map per skill.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] JD input UI working with validation
- [ ] `skills_dictionary.py` populated with 100+ relevant terms
- [ ] `keyword_extractor.py` tested against 5+ real JDs and 3+ resumes
- [ ] Known false-positive/negative issues documented for refinement

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: JD input field in UI.
- Screenshot: extracted keyword sets displayed for a resume + JD pair.

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 5
`extract_keywords()` reliably pulls skill/keyword sets from both resume and JD text using `SKILLS_DB`. Day 5 uses these two keyword sets to build the actual scoring engine: ATS compatibility score, resume-to-job match percentage, and missing skills detection — the core "intelligence" of the rule-based half of HireLens.

---

## 📅 DAY 5 — Scoring Engine: ATS Score, Match %, Missing Skills

### 🎯 Objective
Build the complete rule-based scoring engine — the core deterministic intelligence of HireLens — turning parsed resume/JD text and extracted keywords into the three headline outputs: ATS Compatibility Score, Match Percentage, and Missing Skills.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Designing explainable scoring algorithms (not just a number, but a "why").
- Balancing simplicity/reliability against accuracy in rule-based systems.
- Structuring scoring logic as pure functions for easy testing.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- ATS Compatibility Score algorithm.
- Resume-to-Job Match Percentage algorithm.
- Missing Skills Detection (grouped output).
- A unified `scoring/engine.py` that orchestrates all three and returns one structured result object.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Design the ATS Compatibility Score** (`scoring/ats_score.py`) — evaluates resume *structure*, independent of any specific JD:
   - Checks (each contributes points, sum to 100): presence of standard section headers (Experience/Education/Skills/Projects — via simple text pattern matching), detectable contact info (email/phone pattern via regex), reasonable resume length (not too short/long), no evidence of parsing failure (i.e., text extracted cleanly), bullet point usage detected, absence of excessive special characters/artifacts (signal of table/column-based layout that ATS systems struggle with).
   - Return: `{"score": int, "breakdown": [{"factor": str, "points": int, "note": str}, ...]}`

2. **Design the Match Percentage algorithm** (`scoring/match_score.py`):
   - Core approach: weighted overlap between resume keyword set and JD keyword set (from Day 4's `extract_keywords()`).
   - Formula sketch: `match % = (matched_keywords_weighted / total_jd_keywords_weighted) * 100`, where weighting can boost skills that appear in JD "requirements"/"must-have" sections over general text (simple heuristic: keywords near words like "required," "must have," "proficient in" get higher weight).
   - Return: `{"match_percent": int, "matched_keywords": [...], "total_jd_keywords": int}`

3. **Design Missing Skills Detection** (`scoring/missing_skills.py`):
   - `jd_keywords - resume_keywords` = missing set (from Day 4 extraction).
   - Group by category (using `SKILLS_DB` categories from Day 4) for a clean, readable output rather than a flat list.
   - Return: `{"missing_by_category": {"programming_languages": [...], "tools_platforms": [...], ...}}`

4. **Build `scoring/engine.py`** as the single orchestrating entry point:
   ```python
   def analyze(resume_text: str, jd_text: str) -> dict:
       # returns combined dict with ats_score, match_score, missing_skills, keyword_analysis
   ```
   This is the function the Flask route will call — everything downstream (AI layer on Day 6, report on Day 8) consumes this single structured object.

5. **Wire into Flask:** update the analyze route to call `scoring.engine.analyze()` and display all three results clearly (still on the temporary results page — full dashboard UI comes Day 7).

6. **Calibrate against real data:** run the engine against your 5+ real resume/JD pairs from Days 3–4. Sanity-check: does a strong resume-JD match score meaningfully higher than a weak/unrelated pairing? Adjust weights until scores feel intuitively correct.

### 📂 Files/Folders to Create/Modify
```
scoring/
├── ats_score.py
├── match_score.py
├── missing_skills.py
└── engine.py
```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- Pure Python. No external API. (Optional: `scikit-learn` TF-IDF/cosine similarity as a refinement to match scoring if simple keyword overlap feels too crude after testing — only add if genuinely needed.)

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Run `engine.analyze()` against all test resume/JD pairs; confirm scores feel logically consistent (a well-matched resume/JD pair should clearly outscore a mismatched pair).
- Write simple assertion-based sanity tests (e.g., a `tests/test_scoring.py` with a few hardcoded input/output expectations) to guard against future regressions.
- Test edge cases: empty resume text, empty JD text, resume/JD in an unrelated field (should score low, not crash or score suspiciously high).

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Match % feels too generous/harsh:** tune the weighting formula iteratively against real test pairs rather than guessing — this is expected to take a few iterations.
- **Missing skills list too long/overwhelming:** consider capping displayed items per category (e.g., top 8) with a "+N more" indicator, refined further during UI work on Day 7.
- **ATS score doesn't vary meaningfully across different resumes:** revisit the checks — make sure they're actually differentiating based on structure, not all returning near-identical scores.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] `ats_score.py`, `match_score.py`, `missing_skills.py` implemented and individually tested
- [ ] `scoring/engine.py` orchestrates all three into one clean result object
- [ ] Scores calibrated and sanity-checked against 5+ real resume/JD pairs
- [ ] Basic regression tests written in `tests/test_scoring.py`

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: full scoring output (ATS score, match %, missing skills) for a real test resume/JD pair.

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 6
`scoring/engine.py::analyze(resume_text, jd_text)` is complete and returns a structured dict with `ats_score`, `match_score`, and `missing_skills`. This is the "rule-based half" of HireLens, fully functional and tested independent of any AI API. Day 6 builds the AI layer: feeding this structured analysis (plus raw resume/JD text) into the Claude API to generate the personalized improvement suggestions — the "AI-powered half" of the product.

---

## 📅 DAY 6 — AI Integration Layer (Claude API)

### 🎯 Objective
Build the AI-powered improvement suggestions feature: a clean, isolated, swappable service that sends resume + JD + rule-based analysis to the Claude API and returns structured, consistent, actionable suggestions.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Practical prompt engineering for structured, reliable AI output.
- Building a provider-agnostic AI service abstraction (a real software engineering best practice).
- Defensive handling of external API calls (timeouts, failures, malformed responses) so the core product never breaks if the AI call fails.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- `ai_service/` module with a clean interface, isolated from the rest of the app.
- A structured prompt template that reliably produces consistent, parseable output.
- Graceful fallback behavior if the AI call fails or times out.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Design the AI service interface** (`ai_service/base.py`) — this is the abstraction that makes the provider swappable later:
   ```python
   class AIProvider:
       def generate_suggestions(self, resume_text: str, jd_text: str, analysis: dict) -> dict:
           raise NotImplementedError
   ```

2. **Implement the Claude provider** (`ai_service/claude_provider.py`):
   - Use the `anthropic` Python SDK, reading `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from environment variables (never hardcoded).
   - Construct a tightly structured prompt instructing the model to return **only** a JSON object with a fixed schema, e.g.:
     ```json
     {
       "overall_feedback": "string",
       "strengths": ["string", "..."],
       "priority_improvements": [
         {"area": "string", "suggestion": "string", "example": "string"}
       ],
       "skills_to_highlight": ["string", "..."],
       "tone_notes": "string"
     }
     ```
   - Include the rule-based analysis summary (ATS score, match %, missing skills) in the prompt as context, so suggestions are grounded in the actual detected gaps rather than generic advice.
   - Explicitly instruct the model to keep suggestions specific, practical, and relevant to the Indian IT job market context.

3. **Implement defensive parsing** (`ai_service/response_parser.py`):
   - Strip any markdown code fences the model might add around the JSON.
   - `try/except` JSON parsing; on failure, log the raw response and return a clear fallback structure (`{"error": "AI suggestions temporarily unavailable"}`) rather than crashing.
   - Validate the parsed object has the expected keys before passing it downstream.

4. **Implement timeout and error handling:**
   - Set a reasonable request timeout.
   - Catch API errors (auth failure, rate limit, network error) distinctly and return a user-friendly fallback message in each case, while logging the technical detail server-side.

5. **Wire into Flask:** extend the analyze route to call `ai_service`'s `generate_suggestions()` after the rule-based engine runs, and display the structured suggestions on the page (temporary layout — real UI on Day 7). Add a loading indicator placeholder note (full implementation on Day 7) since this call will be the slowest step in the flow.

6. **Test extensively:** run the full pipeline (parse → score → AI suggestions) against all test resume/JD pairs from prior days. Read every AI response critically — is it actually useful and specific, or generic? Refine the prompt iteratively.

7. **Confirm the core workflow degrades gracefully:** manually simulate an AI failure (e.g., temporarily use an invalid API key) and confirm the rest of the app (parsing + scoring) still works and shows a clear "AI suggestions unavailable" message instead of crashing.

ai_service/
├── __init__.py
├── base.py
├── claude_provider.py
├── response_parser.py
└── prompts.py   # keep the prompt template as its own maintainable constant/function
```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- **Claude API** (`anthropic` Python SDK), authenticated via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Run AI suggestion generation against 5+ resume/JD pairs; confirm output is consistently valid JSON matching the schema.
- Test with a deliberately mismatched resume/JD pair; confirm suggestions still make sense (not nonsensical).
- Simulate an API failure (bad key, forced timeout); confirm graceful fallback, no crash.
- Confirm no API key or sensitive data ever appears in logs shown to the user or committed to Git.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Model returns text before/after the JSON despite instructions:** strengthen the prompt ("Respond with ONLY the JSON object, no other text") and keep the defensive stripping/parsing logic as a safety net regardless.
- **Inconsistent suggestion quality:** add more context to the prompt (e.g., explicitly list the missing skills and low-scoring areas from the rule-based engine so the model has concrete gaps to address).
- **Slow response times:** this is expected with live AI calls — plan for a proper loading state in Day 7's UI work rather than trying to "fix" latency today.
- **Rate limiting during heavy testing:** space out test calls; cache/reuse responses locally during UI development on later days instead of re-calling the API every time.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] `ai_service/` module built with clean provider abstraction
- [ ] Claude API integration working end-to-end
- [ ] Structured JSON output reliably parsed across multiple test cases
- [ ] Graceful fallback confirmed when AI call fails
- [ ] API key confirmed never exposed in logs, UI, or Git history

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: full pipeline output including AI-generated suggestions for a real test pair.
- Screenshot: graceful fallback message when AI call is simulated to fail.

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 7
`ai_service` module is complete: `generate_suggestions(resume_text, jd_text, analysis)` reliably returns structured suggestions or a clean fallback. The full backend pipeline (parse → score → AI suggestions) is functional end-to-end via the temporary results page. Day 7 replaces all temporary UI with the real, polished, responsive dashboard — this is the last major feature-build day before report generation and testing.

---

## 📅 DAY 7 — Frontend Dashboard & Responsive UI

### 🎯 Objective
Replace all temporary/debug UI with a clean, modern, responsive dashboard that presents the full analysis (ATS score, match %, missing skills, keyword analysis, AI suggestions) in a portfolio-quality interface.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Translating raw structured data into clear, scannable visual UI.
- Practical responsive design techniques (mobile + desktop from one codebase).
- UX patterns for loading states and error states in a real product.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- Polished landing/upload page.
- Full results dashboard (scores displayed visually, not just as numbers; missing skills and keyword analysis clearly laid out; AI suggestions presented readably).
- Loading state while analysis/AI call is in progress.
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile).

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Define the visual design direction** before writing markup: modern SaaS aesthetic (clean typography, generous whitespace, a clear primary accent color, subtle shadows/cards — consistent with the "polished, recruiter-facing" goal from the PRD). Sketch or describe the layout for two screens: Upload screen and Results dashboard.

2. **Build the Upload screen** (`templates/index.html`):
   - Clear headline explaining the product in one line.
   - Resume upload (drag-and-drop area + file picker fallback).
   - JD input (textarea, with optional file upload).
   - Prominent "Analyze My Resume" call-to-action button.
   - Basic client-side validation feedback before submission (file type, JD min length).

3. **Build the Results dashboard** (`templates/results.html`):
   - **Score section:** ATS Score and Match % displayed as visual elements (e.g., circular progress indicators or prominent large numbers with color-coded ranges — red/yellow/green) built with plain CSS/SVG (no heavy chart library needed).
   - **Missing Skills section:** grouped, chip/tag-style display by category.
   - **Keyword Analysis section:** clear matched vs. missing breakdown.
   - **AI Suggestions section:** clearly separated cards for overall feedback, strengths, priority improvements (with examples), and skills to highlight — designed to be genuinely readable, not a wall of text.
   - **Download Report button:** placeholder/wired for Day 8's PDF feature.

4. **Implement the loading state:**
   - On form submission, show a clear loading indicator (spinner + short reassuring message, since the AI call takes a few seconds) rather than a frozen/blank screen.
   - Simple approach: server-rendered redirect to results after processing completes, with a JS-driven loading overlay shown immediately on submit for perceived responsiveness. (Keep this simple — no need for complex async job queues at this scope.)

5. **Implement responsive CSS:**
   - Mobile-first or a simple breakpoint-based approach (e.g., single-column stacked layout under ~768px, multi-column above).
   - Test at common widths: mobile (~375px), tablet (~768px), desktop (~1280px+).

6. **Polish error states:**
   - Clear, friendly messaging for: invalid file, JD too short, parsing failure, AI unavailable (using the fallback from Day 6).

7. **Consistent branding:** apply the "HireLens" name, a simple logo/wordmark (can be styled text, no need for a designed logo file), and consistent color scheme throughout.

```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- Plain CSS (or a lightweight utility approach) — no heavy frontend framework needed given the scope.
- No new external libraries required unless a specific need arises (keep dependencies minimal).

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Full end-to-end walkthrough: upload → analyze → view results → (report button present, not yet functional) on desktop.
- Repeat full walkthrough on a mobile-width browser (or real phone) — confirm layout doesn't break.
- Test all error states render clearly (invalid file, short JD, AI fallback).
- Confirm loading state displays correctly and doesn't appear "stuck" or broken.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Layout breaks on mobile:** check for fixed-width elements instead of relative/flexible units; test with browser dev tools' device toolbar.
- **Loading state feels unresponsive:** ensure the spinner/message appears immediately on click, before the (slow) AI call completes.
- **Visual score indicators look off at extreme values (0% or 100%):** explicitly test these edge cases, not just "typical" mid-range scores.
- **Long AI suggestion text overflowing containers:** use proper text wrapping and container constraints; test with an unusually long AI response.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] Upload page polished and functional
- [ ] Results dashboard displays all data (scores, missing skills, keywords, AI suggestions) clearly
- [ ] Loading state implemented and tested
- [ ] Responsive layout confirmed on mobile and desktop widths
- [ ] All error states styled and tested

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 8
The application now has a complete, polished, responsive UI covering the full workflow except PDF report download (button present but not yet wired). Backend pipeline (parsing → scoring → AI) is fully integrated into this UI. Day 8 implements the PDF report generation feature and wires it to the "Download Report" button, then performs the first full end-to-end integration pass.

---

## 📅 DAY 8 — PDF Report Generation & End-to-End Integration

### 🎯 Objective
Build the professional, downloadable PDF report feature and complete the first full end-to-end integration of the entire product — the core workflow from the PRD is now fully functional in one continuous pass.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Programmatic PDF generation and professional document layout.
- Integrating a new module cleanly into an already-working pipeline without regressions.
- End-to-end integration testing discipline.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- PDF report generation (`report/` module).
- "Download Report" button fully wired and functional.
- First complete, uninterrupted end-to-end test of the full user journey.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Design the report layout** on paper/notes first: Header (HireLens branding + candidate/report date), Score summary section (ATS score, match %), Missing skills section, Keyword analysis summary, AI suggestions section (formatted readably), Footer (generated-by note). Keep it to 1–2 pages for a clean, professional feel.

2. **Implement `report/pdf_generator.py`:**
   - If using `reportlab`: build the report using Platypus (flowables) for clean structured layout (headings, paragraphs, tables, spacers).
   - If using `WeasyPrint`: build an HTML/CSS template (`report/templates/report_template.html`) styled specifically for print/PDF output, then render to PDF — often faster to make look polished if comfortable with CSS.
   - Function contract: `generate_pdf_report(analysis: dict, ai_suggestions: dict) -> bytes` (or file path) — takes the same structured data already used by the dashboard, no duplicate data-wrangling logic.

3. **Wire into Flask:**
   - Add a `POST /download-report` (or `GET` with session-stored analysis) route that calls `generate_pdf_report()` and returns the file with correct headers (`Content-Type: application/pdf`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=HireLens_Report.pdf`).
   - Connect the "Download Report" button from Day 7's dashboard to this route.

4. **Handle the data-passing problem cleanly:** since there's no database/accounts, decide how analysis results reach the report route — recommended: store the current analysis result in the Flask session (or pass via a short-lived server-side cache keyed to a request ID) rather than re-running the entire pipeline on download click. Keep this simple; avoid introducing a database for this.

5. **Style the report for professionalism:**
   - Consistent fonts, clear headings/hierarchy, adequate margins, no overflowing text, HireLens branding color used tastefully.
   - Ensure long AI suggestion text wraps properly and doesn't overflow page boundaries.

6. **Run the first true end-to-end integration test:** starting from a completely fresh app restart, walk through the entire journey — upload resume → input JD → analyze → view dashboard → download report — for at least 3 different resume/JD pairs, without any manual intervention or debugging shortcuts. This is the first time the *entire* PRD core workflow runs as one continuous, realistic user session.

7. **Log and fix any integration issues found** — these are expected and normal at this stage; this is exactly why end-to-end testing happens before, not after, deployment.

└── report.py                 # or added to app.py
```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- `reportlab` **or** `WeasyPrint` (final choice made based on Day 2 decision/comfort).

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Generate reports for 5+ different resume/JD result sets; visually inspect each PDF for layout correctness.
- Test with edge cases: very high scores, very low scores, many missing skills (long list), AI fallback scenario (no AI suggestions available) — confirm report still generates cleanly.
- Full end-to-end walkthrough (upload → analyze → dashboard → download) repeated 3+ times without errors.
- Open generated PDFs on more than one PDF viewer if possible (e.g., browser preview and a desktop PDF reader) to catch renderer-specific issues.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Text overflowing page boundaries:** set explicit max-widths/wrapping rules; test with unusually long content deliberately.
- **Report generation fails silently:** wrap generation in try/except with clear server-side logging and a user-facing error if it fails, rather than a broken download.
- **Session data lost between analyze and download steps:** confirm Flask session configuration (secret key set correctly) and that data isn't exceeding session size limits — if it is, switch to a lightweight server-side temporary cache instead of the session cookie directly.
- **Fonts rendering inconsistently:** stick to standard, widely available fonts to avoid PDF rendering surprises.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] PDF report generation implemented and styled professionally
- [ ] Download button fully functional end-to-end
- [ ] Report tested across 5+ varied result scenarios, including edge cases
- [ ] Full end-to-end user journey tested 3+ times with no errors
- [ ] Any integration bugs found today are fixed, not deferred

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: dashboard with working "Download Report" button.
- Screenshot/file: a sample generated PDF report (save one as `docs/sample_report.pdf`).
- Screenshot: full end-to-end flow (can be a short local screen recording, useful later for the Day 10 demo video).

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 9
The entire core workflow (PRD Section 6) is now fully functional end-to-end, including PDF report download. This is a feature-complete v1.0 running locally. Day 9 is dedicated entirely to structured testing, bug fixing, and polish — no new features should be added unless something core is broken.

---

## 📅 DAY 9 — Structured Testing, Bug Fixing & Polish

### 🎯 Objective
Rigorously test the feature-complete application across varied real-world inputs, fix all discovered issues, and polish rough edges — ensuring a stable, professional product going into deployment day.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Structured, systematic QA practices (test matrices, edge-case thinking).
- Prioritizing bug fixes under time constraints (critical vs. cosmetic).
- The discipline of *not* adding new features this late in a build.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- **None.** Today is exclusively testing, bug fixing, and polish. Any new feature idea goes straight into `docs/v2_ideas.md`.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Build a test matrix** covering:
   - **Resume formats:** single-column PDF, multi-column PDF, DOCX with tables, DOCX plain text, resume with unusual fonts/symbols, very short resume, very long (2+ page) resume.
   - **Job descriptions:** short JD, long/detailed JD, JD with unusual formatting, JD in an unrelated field (to test low-match behavior), JD heavily matching the test resume (to test high-match behavior).
   - **Error paths:** invalid file type, oversized file, empty JD, JD below minimum length, simulated AI failure.
   - **Devices/widths:** desktop browser, mobile-width browser, at least one non-Chrome browser if available (e.g., Firefox/Edge) to catch rendering inconsistencies.

2. **Execute the full test matrix systematically**, logging each result (pass/fail/notes) in `docs/test_log.md`.

3. **Triage all discovered issues** into:
   - **Critical (must fix today):** anything breaking the core workflow (crashes, incorrect/missing core outputs, broken downloads).
   - **Cosmetic (fix if time allows):** minor visual inconsistencies, non-blocking UX rough edges.
   - **Deferred (v2.0 backlog):** anything not affecting the core workflow — log in `docs/v2_ideas.md`, do not fix today.

4. **Fix all critical issues first**, retesting each fix against the relevant test matrix row.

5. **Do a full visual polish pass:** consistent spacing, consistent button styles, consistent color usage, check for typos in UI copy, confirm favicon/browser tab title is set correctly, confirm the app doesn't show any leftover debug output, placeholder text, or `console.log` noise in production-facing views.

6. **Performance sanity check:** confirm the full flow (upload → results) completes in a reasonable time even for larger resumes/JDs; confirm no obvious slow points beyond the expected AI call latency.

7. **Security/hygiene pass:**
   - Confirm no API keys appear anywhere in the codebase, logs, or committed files.
   - Confirm uploaded files aren't persisted indefinitely on the server (clean up temp files after processing).
   - Confirm error messages never leak internal stack traces or sensitive details to the end user.

8. **Update documentation as you go:** start drafting the real `README.md` content (setup instructions, feature list, screenshots placeholders) — this reduces Day 10 workload.

### 📂 Files/Folders to Create/Modify
```
docs/
├── test_log.md
└── v2_ideas.md   (updated with any deferred ideas)
README.md          (drafted further)
```
(Modifications spread across whichever modules had bugs — no new modules expected today.)

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- None new. Today is testing/fixing only.

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Execute and log the complete test matrix from Step 1.
- Retest every fixed bug to confirm resolution without new regressions.
- Full end-to-end walkthrough one final time after all fixes, on both desktop and mobile widths.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **Fixing one bug introduces another:** always retest adjacent functionality after any fix, not just the specific failing case.
- **Running out of time before covering the full matrix:** prioritize ruthlessly — core workflow correctness and stability first, cosmetic polish second, always.
- **Temptation to add "just one more feature":** redirect firmly to `v2_ideas.md`; today's job is stability, not scope.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] Full test matrix executed and logged in `docs/test_log.md`
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed and retested
- [ ] Visual polish pass completed
- [ ] Security/hygiene pass completed (no leaked keys, no persisted uploads, no leaked stack traces)
- [ ] `README.md` drafted (setup + features sections at minimum)
- [ ] Any deferred ideas logged in `v2_ideas.md`, not implemented

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: completed `test_log.md` showing test coverage.
- Screenshot: polished final UI state (for comparison with Day 7's earlier version).

### ➡️ Handoff Notes for Day 10
HireLens v1.0 is now feature-complete, tested against a structured matrix, and stable locally. All known critical bugs are fixed; remaining ideas are safely parked in `v2_ideas.md`. Day 10 is entirely focused on deployment, final documentation, architecture diagrams, screenshots, the demo video, and final portfolio packaging — no new features or fixes unless deployment surfaces a genuine blocker.

---

## 📅 DAY 10 — Deployment, Documentation & Portfolio Packaging

### 🎯 Objective
Deploy HireLens to a public URL, finalize all documentation and visual assets, record the demo video, and package the project as a complete, recruiter-ready portfolio piece.

### 📖 What I'll Learn
- Deploying a Python web application to a live production environment.
- Managing secrets/environment variables safely in production.
- Writing documentation and presenting a project the way real engineering teams do.

### 🛠 Features to Build
- No new product features. Deployment configuration, documentation, and packaging only.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Choose the deployment platform** (confirm based on what's genuinely free and suitable at this time — e.g., Render, Railway, or similar Python-friendly free-tier host). Guidance will be provided step-by-step for whichever platform is chosen, including account creation, connecting the GitHub repo, and configuring the build/start commands.

2. **Prepare the app for production:**
   - Add a `Procfile` or equivalent start command file if required by the chosen platform.
   - Confirm `requirements.txt` is complete and pinned to working versions.
   - Set `debug=False` (or platform-equivalent) for the production Flask app.
   - Confirm the app reads `PORT` from environment variables if the platform requires it.

3. **Configure environment variables on the deployment platform:**
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and any other required variables) via the platform's dashboard/secrets manager — never in code or committed files.

4. **Deploy and verify:**
   - Trigger the deployment.
   - Once live, run the full end-to-end test matrix (from Day 9) again against the **production URL**, not just locally — this catches the "works locally, breaks in production" risk called out in the PRD.
   - Fix any deployment-specific issues immediately (this is the one exception to "no new fixes on Day 10" — deployment blockers must be resolved).

5. **Finalize `README.md`:**
   - Project title, one-line pitch, and HireLens branding.
   - Problem statement and target users (from PRD).
   - Feature list.
   - Screenshots (upload page, dashboard, sample report).
   - Tech stack summary.
   - Architecture diagram (from Day 2, refined if needed).
   - Local setup instructions (clone, venv, install, `.env` setup, run).
   - Live demo link.
   - Link to demo video.
   - Future scope (v2.0 ideas, pulled from `v2_ideas.md`).

6. **Finalize architecture documentation:**
   - Update/clean the Day 2 architecture diagram to reflect the as-built system.
   - Ensure it's saved in `docs/` and referenced in the README.

7. **Capture final screenshots:** clean, professional screenshots of upload page, results dashboard (desktop + mobile), and a sample PDF report — save in `docs/screenshots/`.

8. **Record the demo video (2–5 minutes):**
   - Suggested structure: (1) quick problem statement (10–15s), (2) live walkthrough of the full flow — upload, JD input, analyzing, reviewing dashboard, downloading report (60–90s), (3) brief mention of technical approach — rule-based scoring + AI-powered suggestions, architecture (30–45s), (4) closing note on future scope/vision (15–20s).
   - Screen recording tool guidance will be provided step-by-step based on your OS.

9. **Final Git hygiene:**
   - Confirm commit history is clean and descriptive (squash/clean up if needed).
   - Confirm `.env` was never committed at any point (double-check history, not just current state).
   - Tag the final commit as `v1.0` (`git tag v1.0`).
   - Push everything, including tags.

10. **Final portfolio packaging:**
    - Update resume/LinkedIn with the HireLens project, live link, and GitHub link.
    - Prepare a short written project summary (2–3 sentences) reusable for applications and LinkedIn posts — can reuse language from the Pitch Deck's Vision/Solution sections.

```

### 🔗 APIs/Libraries/Tools to Integrate
- Chosen deployment platform (Render/Railway/equivalent).
- Screen recording tool (OS-native or simple free tool) for the demo video.

### 🧪 Testing Tasks
- Full end-to-end test matrix re-run against the **live production URL**.
- Confirm environment variables/secrets work correctly in production (AI suggestions functional live, not just locally).
- Confirm the live app performs acceptably (no excessive cold-start delays beyond what's reasonable for a free-tier host — document this as a known constraint if present).
- Click every link in the finalized `README.md` to confirm nothing is broken.

### 🐞 Common Issues & Debugging Tips
- **App works locally but crashes in production:** almost always an environment variable, missing dependency, or file-path assumption issue — check platform logs first.
- **Free-tier host "cold starts" (slow first load after inactivity):** this is a known, acceptable limitation of free hosting — document it plainly in the README rather than treating it as a bug.
- **API key not working in production despite being set correctly locally:** confirm the variable name matches exactly (case-sensitive) between code and platform dashboard.
- **Deployment platform build fails:** check `requirements.txt` for version conflicts or missing system-level dependencies some libraries require.

### ✅ End-of-Day Checklist
- [ ] Application successfully deployed to a public URL
- [ ] Full test matrix re-verified against production
- [ ] `README.md` finalized with all required sections
- [ ] Architecture diagram and screenshots finalized in `docs/`
- [ ] Demo video (2–5 min) recorded and linked
- [ ] Git history clean, `v1.0` tag pushed
- [ ] Project added to resume/LinkedIn/portfolio

### 📸 Expected Project State & Screenshots
- Screenshot: live production URL running the full app.
- Screenshot: finalized GitHub repo (README rendered, clean structure, `v1.0` tag visible).
- File: demo video (linked, e.g., via YouTube unlisted link or GitHub-hosted).

### ➡️ Handoff Notes — Capstone Complete
HireLens v1.0 is fully built, tested, deployed, and documented. All PRD success criteria (Section 10) are met. The project is ready to be presented to recruiters and discussed in technical interviews. Any future work continues from `docs/v2_ideas.md`, which now serves as the v2.0 planning backlog.
